= Built-in network isolation

Skupper provides default, built-in security that scales across clusters and clouds.
In a Skupper network, the connections between Skupper routers are secured with mutual TLS using a private, dedicated certificate authority (CA).
Each router is uniquely identified by its own certificate.

This means that the Skupper network is isolated from external access, preventing security risks such as lateral attacks, malware infestations, and data exfiltration.
