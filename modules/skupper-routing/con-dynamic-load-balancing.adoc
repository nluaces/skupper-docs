= Dynamic load balancing

Balance requests across clusters according to service capacity.

The Skupper network has cross-cluster visibility.
It can see which services are already loaded and which have spare capacity, and it directs requests accordingly.

You can assign a cost to each inter-cluster connection.
This enables you to configure a preference for one resource over another.
If demand is normal, you can keep all traffic on your private cloud.
If demand peaks, you can dynamically spill over to public cloud resources.
