Skupper is an open source tool for creating VANs in Kubernetes.
By using Skupper, you can create a distributed application comprised of microservices running in different Kubernetes clusters.

This diagram illustrates a Skupper network that connects three services running in three different Kubernetes clusters:

In a Skupper network, each namespace contains a Skupper instance.
When these Skupper instances connect, they continually share information about the services that each instance exposes.
This means that each Skupper instance is always aware of every service that has been exposed to the Skupper network, regardless of the namespace in which each service resides.

Once a Skupper network is formed across Kubernetes namespaces, any of the services in those namespaces can be exposed (through annotation) to the Skupper network.
When a service is exposed, Skupper creates proxy endpoints to make that service available on each namespace in the Skupper network.
