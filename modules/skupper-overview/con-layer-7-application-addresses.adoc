= Layer 7 application addresses

A Layer 7 application address represents an endpoint, or destination in the VAN.
When an application sends a communication to an address, the Layer 7 application routers distribute the communication to any other application in the VAN that has the same address.

For example, in this diagram, *Service B* sends a message with an application address to its local application router.
*Service A* and *Service C* are subscribed to the same address, so the application router routes copies of the message through the VAN until they arrive at each destination.

VANs provide multiple routing patterns, so communications can be distributed in anycast (balanced or closest) or multicast patterns.
