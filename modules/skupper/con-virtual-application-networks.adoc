= Virtual Application Networks

Skupper solves multi-cluster communication challenges through something called a Virtual Application Network (VAN).
To understand the value of Skupper, it is helpful to first understand what a VAN is.

A VAN connects the applications and services in your hybrid cloud into a virtual network so that they can communicate with each other as if they were all running in the same site.
In this diagram, a VAN connects three services, each of which is running in a different cloud:

In essence, the VAN connects the services in a distributed application with a microservice architecture.

VANs are able to provide connectivity across the hybrid cloud because they operate at Layer 7 (the application layer).
They use *Layer 7 application routers* to route communication between *Layer 7 application addresses*.
