= Layer 7 application routers

Layer 7 application routers form the backbone of a VAN in the same way that conventional network routers form the backbone of a VPN.
However, instead of routing IP packets between network endpoints, Layer 7 application routers route messages between application endpoints (called Layer 7 application addresses).
